# Weaviate in golang for some reason

1. I don't know why I was using this. Probably because I wanted vector stores interactable with golang client and open source. 
2. I have a larger desire to use qdrant, chroma, milvus, and more before weaviate now. Maybe I wasn't impressed?
3. according to my stream notes I looked at this on May 5th. I bet the VoD for that day shows what I found. https://twitch.tv/AdjectiveAllison if future allison or whoever is reading this wants to go look for what I thought.
