## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of various code projects, experiments, and learning endeavors. It's a workspace for exploring different technologies, programming languages, and concepts. While the projects here may not be complete or production-ready, they represent ongoing learning and experimentation.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains several subdirectories, each focusing on a different project or learning area:

- `learning-zig/`: Experiments and exercises in learning the Zig programming language.
- `random-local-bash/`: A collection of useful bash scripts for local process automation.
- `transcription/`: Experiments with speech recognition and transcription using various technologies.
- `wasix-threads/`: Testing and exploration of WebAssembly threading capabilities using Wasix and Wasmer runtime.
- `weaviate-test/`: Experiments with the Weaviate vector database in Go.
- `webview-zig-test/`: A project demonstrating the use of WebView with Zig for cross-platform desktop application development.

## Key Projects

### WebView Zig Project

Located in `webview-zig-test/`, this project demonstrates the creation of cross-platform desktop applications using WebView and Zig. It combines a local file server with a WebView to serve and display web content securely.

Key features:
- Local file server for secure content delivery
- WebView integration for native window display
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Two-way communication between Zig backend and JavaScript frontend

For more details, see the project's [README](webview-zig-test/README.md).

### Zig Learning

The `learning-zig/` directory contains various experiments and exercises related to learning the Zig programming language. This includes explorations of Zig's memory allocation, concurrency features, and more.

### Transcription Experiments

The `transcription/` directory includes projects exploring speech recognition and transcription technologies, with experiments in both Go and TinyGo.

## Usage

Each subdirectory contains its own README with specific instructions for running or using the project. Generally, to explore a project:

1. Navigate to the project's directory.
2. Read the project-specific README for setup and running instructions.
3. Install any necessary dependencies.
4. Run the project using the provided instructions.

## Contributing

While this repository primarily serves as a personal learning and experimentation space, suggestions, improvements, and discussions are welcome. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you have ideas or improvements to share.
